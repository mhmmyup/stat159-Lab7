The reproducibility process is absolutely core to good research behavior. But it isn't perfect and can be challenging. These tools are not completely intuitive and can be a pain to set up, but once you get them working, you can see the power in every single one.

The makefile allows me to make small iterations to files which are one of many used in a larger file and then easily alter the end file as I please. Pandoc lets me write in markdown and then convert it to a webpage I can share with the world. Markdown lets me frame my thoughts and intersperse them with code, images, links, and more. And git with github give me a procedue within which I can slowly iterate my changes and share them with the world. Once they start coming together, it's a very liberating experience. Things can go smoothly and all my iterations are tracked and reproducible. I don't have to worry about forgetting to update a certain file if it uses other files to make it. Everything works together in a cool harmony!

I had a good deal of fun writing this and it helped reinforce to me how reproducibility can improve accountability. I think lying or obfuscating research is a contemporary cardinal sin, so I hope tools like this become more popular and used by all.

Github is still a pretty annoying platform, so I'm glad that git lets me not even think about it at all besides connecting to it! I always get confused on the site. Very unintuitive. Good thing it doesn't matter too much.

I talked a bit about Windows 10 bash and makefiles with other people to hash out my thoughts and work on them together. Those two can be finicky and you have to do everything just right, so I'm glad I had people to bounce ideas off of.

This didn't take too long as a whole, but I bluescreened in the middle of it :( So I lost a good deal of work. This was actually a great lesson, while working on this project, on why iteration and documented changes matter! I lost a ton because I wasn't saving and commiting as much as I should've. Lesson Learned!

I hope this tutorial will be a good reference for me in the future and was a good writiing exercise to really have me negotiate with why these tools are useful and how to best use them. Thanks for reading!
