#Hi

This is a general tutorial and explanation of how to use certain programs, packages, and file manipulation systems to create a reproducible workflow. Now, what may immediately come to your mind is: What does it mean for something to be reproducible? What is a reproducible workflow? And why does it matter?  

Put simply, the reason we put all this effort into making something "reproducible" is an ultimately simple aim: we want to create works and code and files that can be reassembled, piece by piece, and can be re-ran or re-executed from anywhere by anyone, such that anyone can follow the process we use to make reports and research and do it on their own. We, as programmers, statisticians, researchers, and academics, can sometimes forget the work that we have founded our study on, or that we, too, can contribute in a meaningful way to advancing the sum total of accessible and parsable human knowledge. We can help out everyone by using just a few tools to make our research process reproducible, and thus, far more useful!

Principles of reproducibility are far from the norm in computing practices, and may seem daunting or a hassle at first. Learning these tools and how to use them quickly and efficiently to best suit the reproduction process will make implementing the reproducible workflow simplified and logical. Hopefully we, as a programming culture, can come to see the importance of systems like this to make
