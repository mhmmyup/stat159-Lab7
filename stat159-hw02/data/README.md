This directory contains our main data sets. First, we have Advertising.csv, which is the data set which we analyzed in this entire regression/analysis process. This can be downloaded by using the Makefile in the parent directory. The data set, from ISLR, is open to all! The link can also be found in the makefile. eda-output.txt, as mentioned in the code/ directory, contains some basic summary statistics of the two variables which we were considering. These can give you a better sense of what the two variables and the data as a whole look like. Lastly, we have regression.RData, which is merely where we store our two regression objects from the analysis step, so that they can be called in to any file without having to carry out the regression process every time. We use this primarily in our final report to supplement the narrative.
