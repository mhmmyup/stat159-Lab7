Here is my repository of files for the HW2 reproducibility assignment. In the reports/ directory, you will find the finalized narrative of the simple linear regression analysis I carried out. In the images/ directory, you will find exploratory images and the final scatterplot with least-squares regression line overlay. In the data/ directory, you'll find the primary data set, and other intermediary bits of data from the analysis process. In the code/ directory, you'll find the various RScripts used to bring all these disparate parts together, make the intermediary data sets, and do basic analysis.
