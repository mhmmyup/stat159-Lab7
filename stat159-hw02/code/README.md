In this directory are the two main RScripts I implemented to analyze and process the data. We began with a .csv file, and with the eda-script.R we did some exploratory data analysis. While these weren't too helpful in forming the actual final narrative report, the summary statistics could theoretically ahve helped inform our interpretation of the data, make decisions on what to do, and generally give us a better idea of what the data we are working with looks like. With this, we created 2 histograms, one for each of the two variables we analyzed, which can be found in images/, and created an exploratory data text file which contains some general summary statistics of each variable.

The regression-script.R is where our actual regression was carried out. Since the regression wasn't too complicated, the code is pretty direct and barebones. Here, we create the scatterplot, the regression line, and overlay the two together to create our analysis image. Additionally, we save the two main regression objects in an .RData file, so we can easily call these regression objects in any other file without reading in the data first, etc. We use this .RData file later, in the report, to supplement our narrative with some statistical tables.
